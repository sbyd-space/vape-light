# vape flashlight
An educational DIY kit for converting a disposable vape into a rechargeable flashlight

The kit is used in workshops to educate about:
* environmental and social impact of resource extraction
* resource consumption of electronics and disposable products
* basic hands-on soldering skills

It is accompanied by a [zine][zine] containing contextual information about these topics and instructions for assembly.

The pcbs were developed with [KiCad 8.0][kicad].  
[KiKit 1.6.0][kikit] was used for the panelization of the PCBs for production.  
Visualizations were made with [Blender 4.2][blender] and [pcb2blender 2.15][pcb2blender].  
The fabrication files were generated with [Fabrication Toolkit 5.0.1][fabricationtoolkit].  
The files for 3D printing were generated from [OpenSCAD 2021.01][openscad].
